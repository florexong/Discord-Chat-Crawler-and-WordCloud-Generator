# Discord Website Chat Crawler and WordCloud Generator

This repository contains a script that crawls text messages from Discord using the Discord API and generate WordCloud.

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file with the following structure:
    ```
    key = 
    id = 
    ```
   Note: Do not enclose the key and ID values in quotes, keep them as they are. For information on where to find the key and ID, please refer to [this](https://hongchai.medium.com/scraping-discord-channels-d5de7ee87abe) article.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the `main.py` script.

4. Run the `WC.py` script.

And voila! That's how you can crawl chat messages from Discord and generate a word cloud.
